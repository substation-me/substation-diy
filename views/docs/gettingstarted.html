          <h3>First things first</h3>
          <p>
            Substation is free software. That means independence and control. You can make your community truly 
            yours and customize things however you like. But you'll have to edit a config file and some html. There
            is set-up. That might sound intimidating, but you can handle it.

            Potential members first interact with substation using the sign-up embed.
            This can live on your site or on a simple page hosted by substation — or both even. There's a dashboard you can use 
            to email all members or export a CSV. It's all built on a simple API that handles email verification,
            mailing campaigns, and recurring paments.
          </p><p>
            You can see the sign-up embed in the demo above. Here are a few pictures of the dashboard and email.

          <h3>So how does it work?</h3>
          <p>
            Substation is just a few parts stitched together with a library we built called 
            <a href="https://lodge.substation.dev/">Lodge</a>. For now you'll need accounts with <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank">Braintree</a>
            (payments) and <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/" taget="_blank">Mailgun</a> (bulk email) to get it all 
            running. Neither service will cost you anything up front except a little time for set up.
          </p><p>
            Lodge handles the responsive embed, which can open a full-screen checkout overlay on any page, 
            and it's as easy to embed as a YouTube video:
          </p>
          
          <code class="embed">
            &lt;!-- Substation embed code --&gt;
            <br />
            &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/substationhq/lodge@0.9.1/dist/lodge.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
            &lt;embed class="lodge" src="{{substationURL}}embed"&gt;<br />
          </code>

          <p>
            Now here's the weird thing: there's no database. We wanted to make substation as easy to use as possible,
            so we designed around what we could do with just a payment API and email authentication. So all customer
            information is stored safely with the payment provider, and user authentication happens pretty much like 
            every other site resets a password — except without a password. Just push a button in your inbox to 
            login. 
          </p><p> 
            This means all of substation is configured and customized with a single <code>.env</code> file 
            and a few markup/css files for customization. More importantly it makes custom software a lot less
            intimidating. Databases can cut you.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Substation is a work in progress. Right now we're exploring more payment options and services for Lodge. After that the idea is to move substation
            towards more of a serverless architecture, but carefully so it can work on services like Glitch and Vercel 
            side by side. 
          </p><p>
            We're going to keep making substation easier and better, because we think it's important for people to have
            more ways to connect and support each other directly.
